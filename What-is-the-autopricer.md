TF2Autobot used to use [prices.tf](https://prices.tf/) (credits to [@Nicklason](https://github.com/Nicklason)) as its autopricing source. This autopricer has been shutdown.

Now TF2Autobot uses [pricedb.io](https://pricedb.io/) (credits to [@Oliver Perring](https://github.com/OliverPerring)) as its autopricing source.

Pricedb.io is independent from TF2Autobot and there is no way for us to directly change its prices. For issues with the autopricer feel free to ask for help in the [PriceDB.io discord server](https://discord.com/invite/7H2bceTgQK).

It may not always accurately represent the current market prices due to not following every price change immediately. It doesn't undercut or overcut.
