To run the bot you will open up the command prompt by typing `cmd` in your windows search bar.

Once the command prompt is open you will want to `cd` (Change directory) to your tf2autobot folder. In our example installation, we choose to install the bot on the Desktop. 

This means that we will type `cd Desktop\tf2autobot` into the command prompt.

To start the bot we will type `node dist/app.js`

Your bot should be online on Steam in a minute. 

If your bot does not come online you should check the output in the command prompt and see if it matches any of the errors described in our [common errors on startup.](https://github.com/idinium96/tf2autobot/wiki/Common-Errors)

To shutdown your bot you can simply close the command prompt.
